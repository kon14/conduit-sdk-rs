Conduit is a self-hosted backend, that aims to cut down development times
by providing ready-made modules that offer common functionality out of the box, and allowing
maximum flexibility to add custom functionality.

While Conduit's official microservices are built in TypeScript, module intercommunication is accomplished through gRPC,
allowing for third party clients and servers to be written in any programming language offering a gRPC implementation.

This project intends to implement a Conduit SDK for Rust.<br />
At the moment, it's just a **work-in-progress** with **<ins>no official support</ins>**!

## Prerequisites 🤔

The following section assumes your environment contains:

- an installation of the [Rust development toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)

Additionally, you should have access to a local/remote instance of Conduit.<br />
If you already have Conduit's CLI installed on your system, you may bring up a local dev environment via:

``` bash
# Option A: Basic Deployment
conduit deploy setup

# Option B: Parameterized Deployment
conduit deploy setup --config
```

For additional information on Conduit environment bootstrapping options, check out the [installation section](https://getconduit.dev/docs/installation
) of the official project docs.

## Examples 🧩

The following example demonstrates distributed service discovery synchronization.<br />

``` bash
CONDUIT_SERVER_URL="0.0.0.0:55152" cargo run --example monitor_state
```

The example's code establishes a connection to Conduit and calls `Conduit::monitor_state()`, retrieving an initialized `Arc<RwLock<ServiceDiscoveryState>>`.

Every 500ms, the local state gets logged, while a background task takes care of keeping it in sync with the remote service discovery state.

_Output_
```
Waiting for Conduit...
Conduit connection established!

## Networking 🕸️

If you're running the above example while connecting to a containerized Conduit environment,
such as the ones provided by Conduit's CLI, you might have noticed your modules' gRPC addresses
looking an awful lot like hostnames (eg: `grpc://conduit-database:55160`).

Your guess would be correct. We provide the SDK with Conduit Core's hostname and port combo,
as exposed on the host computer, but the reality is, our microservices are still communicating inside a container network,
as such, they internally refer to each other via their corresponding hostnames.

Your services might alternatively be running somewhere on the cloud,
communicating via internal ip/port pairs that may, or may not, be publicly exposed to the public internet exactly as is.

However, if your own code isn't executing inside that very same environment,
and you haven't otherwise explicitly configured any of your own system-level mappings
for the module addresses advertised by Conduit's service discovery,
your gRPC clients are unlikely to be able to reach any services behind these unexposed aliases.

Hence, this SDK provides a mechanism for remapping any module addresses reported
by Core with explicitly defined static overrides.

You may specify your mappings by setting the `MODULE_URL_REMAP` env to a stringified JSON object.<br />
Use module names (as represented by service discovery) for the keys
and the publicly exposed gRPC addresses (eg `0.0.0.0:55160`) for the values.

`MODULE_URL_REMAP='{"database":"0.0.0.0:55160","router":"0.0.0.0:55161","authentication":"0.0.0.0:55162","chat":"0.0.0.0:55163","email":"0.0.0.0:55164","forms":"0.0.0.0:55165","pushNotifications":"0.0.0.0:55166","sms":"0.0.0.0:55167","storage":"0.0.0.0:55168","authorization":"0.0.0.0:55169"}'`
